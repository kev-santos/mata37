        <u>How tutorials will run</u> <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting in Week 3 (week of May 23rd), tutorials will have an evaluation <b>every week</b>.</li>
        <li>Evaluations will be held at the start of tutorial.</li>
        <li>The evaluation will be based on the assignment released the previous week. If this is week N, it will be based on assignment N-2.</li>
        <li>This evaluation will be <b>either</b> a quiz OR you will hand in your solutions to the homework questions from the relevant assignment. (<b>Only</b> the "Homework" questions, not the "Exercises")</li>
        <li>You will find out which it will be (quiz or hand-in) at the start of tutorial.</li>
        <li>Before tutorial, you should have completed and written down your solutions to the homework questions.</li>
        <li>You may only submit evaluations in the tutorial you're officially registered in (the one you're enrolled in on ACORN).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <u>Some advice for this course</u> <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Make your own set of notes so you can easily refer to definitions and theorems.</li>
            <li>Do all the questions and exercises on the assignment, not just the ones you have to hand in.</li>
            <li>Practice the T/F questions in particular.</li>
            <li>Attend office hours and ask questions.</li>
        </ul>
